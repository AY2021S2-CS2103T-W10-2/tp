**StoreMando is a **desktop app for managing inventory, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, StoreMando can get your inventory
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* If you are interested in using StoreMando, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User
  Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing StoreMando, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to
  start.
