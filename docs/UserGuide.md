## 3. Features <a name="features"></a>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/ITEM_NAME`, `ITEM_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Chocolate Milk`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/ITEM_NAME [e/EXPIRY_DATE]` can be used as `n/Olive Oil e/2020-10-10` or as `n/Olive Oil`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/favourite`, `t/favourite t/drink` etc.

* Parameters can be specified in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/ITEM_NAME l/LOCATION`, `l/LOCATION n/ITEM_NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `e/2020-10-10 e/2020-08-08`, only `e/2020-08-08` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
