## Project: StoreMando

StoreMando is a **desktop app for managing inventory, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, StoreMando can get your inventory
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Modify Feature**: Modified Find feature.
    * What it does: Finds items whose names contain any of the given keywords, either in full or partially.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can find items of their choice by
      keying in the name of the item.
    * Highlights: This enhancement allows for partial name finding compared to the original full name finding. This
      gives users more flexibility when they are looking for items.

* **Modify Feature**: Modified List feature.
    * What it does: allows the user to list out items in full, by location, or by tag.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is allowed to get a sublist that
      fits their specific requirement.
    * Highlights: This enhancement allows the user to list items according to more specific requirement. This gives the
      user more flexibility when they want a sublist from the full list.

* **Code

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36]()
      , [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
        * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
    * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
    * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

* _{you can add/remove categories in the list above}_
