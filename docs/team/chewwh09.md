## Project: StoreMando

**StoreMando** is an integrated platform fully customised for residents in households, residential colleges and halls,
to help users manage their items effectively and efficiently. StoreMando allows users to keep track of their items'
whereabouts, quantities and expiry dates with a few simple commands. Furthermore, StoreMando also comes with an inbuilt
reminder feature to help users keep track of items that are expiring. All items' information is encapsulated clearly on
our simple and clean Graphical User Interface (GUI). Our application is optimised for use via the Command Line
Interface (CLI) and if users have quick fingers, StoreMando can help users manage their items in the blink of an eye.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
