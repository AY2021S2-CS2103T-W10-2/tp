* This is the CS2103T Project for **Team CS2103T-W10-2**, the name of the project is StoreMando.

* This product is a centralized inventory manager that helps to track the location of items in a household, their
  individual quantities and respective expiry dates (if applicable). <br>
  The usage of this product can eventually extend to other places outside households, however the core of our
  development will surround the usage in a household.

* It is named `StoreMando`, a combination of the words Storage and Commando, the goal of our product is to make it the
  go-to product to track inventory.

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see
  the **[StoreMando Product Website](https://ay2021s2-cs2103t-w10-2.github.io/tp/)**.
